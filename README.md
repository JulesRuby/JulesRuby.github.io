# Personal Developer Portfolio

I decided I disliked my original portfolio, and opted to make a more simplified portfolio using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. Also suspending my original Vue portfolio project, as it seemed a bit excessive and perhaps less accessible to all browser types.

This isn't entirely complete, but I'm just aiming to have a usable MVP, and will add more on as time passes and I have ideas I want to implement.
